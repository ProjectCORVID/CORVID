# CORVID Project Plan
**Consentual Objective Reality: Virtualized, Interpreted, Distributed**

## Executive Summary

CORVID is a platform for collaborative narrative development where users create interconnected fictional universes. The system enables creators to establish shared boundaries between their respective universes, allowing for predictable cross-universe interactions while maintaining creative autonomy within individual narrative domains.

**Core Philosophy**: "It's more important to be believable than realistic."
