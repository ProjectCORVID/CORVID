# CORVID

Consentual Objective Reality: Virtualized, Interpreted, Distributed

See [the wiki](https://github.com/stormagnet/CORVID) for introduction, news etc.

The current goal is to have something other people can play with as easily as possible. Instructions might look something like this:

    $ npm install
    $ npm install path/to/finch
    $ node world/finch

## About the 'rewrite' branch

There is saying that a programmer (or any artist for that matter) should plan
to throw away the first two versions of any remotely interesting work she
undertakes. This branch is probably the 15th "start from scratch", but I
(rdeforest) am being more intentional about it this time.
